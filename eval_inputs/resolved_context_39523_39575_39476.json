      "title": "Will China be able to mass produce humanoid robots by the end of 2025?",
      "type": "binary",
      "resolution_criteria": "The question resolves Yes if credible reports indicate a robotics company with headquarters in China has manufactured more than a thousand humanoid robots of an identical model before the end of 2025.",
      "fine_print": "A humanoid robot in this context means: a bi-pedal robot with two arms, two legs, a head and torso; that can perform at least the basic tasks of walking, picking up objects and carrying; these will perform tasks autonomously driven by AI; they should not be directly controlled by humans.",
      "description": "From the Humanoid robot Wikipedia page: A humanoid robot is a robot resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body, for example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots also have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths. Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans. Current progress: By 2025, China aims to establish an initial humanoid robot innovation system, achieving breakthroughs in crucial components such as brains, cerebellum, and limbs, while ensuring a safe and efficient supply of core components. The production level for these robots is expected to reach an advanced international standard, with mass production occurring. These robots are anticipated to demonstrate their effectiveness across various fields, from manufacturing to livelihood services. Among China's most advanced projects are those by Xiaomi and Fourier Intelligence. Xiaomi is working on its CyberOne, a robot that is supposed to be capable not only of perceiving space in 3D, but also of recognizing individuals and interpreting their gestures, expressions and emotions. Combined with artificial intelligence, it could one day interact directly with humans. For its part, Fourier Intelligence is preparing to launch its first humanoid robot, the GR-1, specialized in medical actions, capable of moving at 5 km/h and carrying loads of several dozen kilograms. Its first deliveries are scheduled for 2024.",

      "title": "Will the US enact export controls for some generative AI software before 2026?",
      "type": "binary",
      "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as YES if, by Dec 31 2025, the US imposes export controls on some generative AI software, and NO otherwise.",
      "fine_print": "The export controls need not be specifically to China; anything under the standard export regime of the US would qualify. The export controls must be specifically related to AI that can generate content. It is not sufficient if software produced by Microsoft or OpenAI cannot be exported to certain countries for other reasons, such as export bans on all software, or on all commercial products sold to certain countries. These need to be actual export controls, as per the 2022 controls on semiconductors. Taxes or trade deals are not considered here.",
      "description": "As of May 2023, US law does not have export controls on the sale of software services that include powerful generative AI. As such, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft can sell LLM-assisted document writing, image generation, video generation, etc. to enterprises worldwide (up to more general export controls not focused on AI). In Oct 2022, the US implemented export controls that, roughly speaking, ban export of semiconductors that involve US in their manufacturing chain to China. As the capabilities of generative AI systems grow, and as enterprise customers learn more how to extract certain types of knowledge (e.g. how to create deepfakes or create armies of online bots), one way US policymakers might address risks would be to apply export controls to software that are similar to the export controls for hardware used for training AI.",

      "title": "Will US imports from Brazil in November 2025 exceed those of November 2024?",
      "type": "binary",
      "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as Yes if the dollar amount of imports into the United States from Brazil for November 2025 exceeds the amount for November 2024, according to data presented by the US Census Bureau at its Trade in Goods with Brazil tracker.",
      "fine_print": "Question resolves based on the amount shown when first accessed by Metaculus. Later updates will not cause the question to re-resolve.",
      "description": "In mid July 2025, according to CNN: Trump threatened Brazil with crippling tariffs of 50% starting August 1, according to a letter posted to his social media platform, Truth Social. In the letter, Trump linked the astronomical tariff threat to what he described as a witch hunt trial against Brazil's right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, a close Trump ally, is facing trial in Brazil for allegedly attempting to overthrow Lula following his presidential win in 2022. He could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup. Speaking exclusively to CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday, da Silva, who is widely known as Lula, said that Trump's threats had broken away from protocol and argued that his predecessor's fate cannot be part of trade negotiations. Top products the US imports from Brazil are coffee, oil, and sugar. Brazil provides about 37% of America's domestic sugar consumption needs, so a potential trade war could be coming at a time when The Coca-Cola Company just announced it was switching from high fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its sodas.",
