The original question opened on 2024-02-25 02:58:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/19878). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n#### From the [ Humanoid robot Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot)\n\nA humanoid robot is a robot resembling the human body in shape. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes. In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some humanoid robots may replicate only part of the body, for example, from the waist up. Some humanoid robots also have heads designed to replicate human facial features such as eyes and mouths. Androids are humanoid robots built to aesthetically resemble humans.\n\n![Chinese robots](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1200x800/public/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/03/48249435-6ad4-4b8a-bd02-c43ede74bce4_55bf4566.jpg?itok=cYZpFgtd&v=1699004362)\n\n\n####Current progress\n\nBy 2025, China aims to establish an initial humanoid robot innovation system, achieving breakthroughs in crucial components such as “brains, cerebellum, and limbs,” while ensuring a safe and efficient supply of core components. The production level for these robots is expected to reach an advanced international standard, with mass production occurring. These robots are anticipated to demonstrate their effectiveness across various fields, from manufacturing to livelihood services.\n\nAmong China's most advanced projects are those by Xiaomi and Fourier Intelligence. Xiaomi is working on its CyberOne, a robot that is supposed to be capable not only of perceiving space in 3D, but also of recognising individuals and interpreting their gestures, expressions and emotions. Combined with artificial intelligence, it could one day interact directly with humans. For its part, Fourier Intelligence is preparing to launch its first humanoid robot, the GR-1, specialised in medical actions, capable of moving at 5 km/h and carrying loads of several dozen kilogrammes. Its first deliveries are scheduled for 2024.\n\n####For more details on China's progress see:\n\n* https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/china-ministry-pushes-for-humanoid-robot-mass-production-by-2025-and-100-billion-market-by-2030.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\n* https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2023/11/09/china-aims-to-mass-produce-humanoid-robots-by-2027\n* https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3240259/china-says-humanoid-robots-are-new-engine-growth-pushes-mass-production-2025-and-world-leadership\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":19878,\"question_id\":19878}}`",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of May 2023, US law does not have export controls on the sale of software services that include powerful generative AI. As such, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft can sell LLM-assisted document writing, image generation, video generation, etc. to enterprises worldwide (up to more general export controls not focused on AI.)\n\nIn Oct 2022, the [US implemented export controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_New_Export_Controls_on_Advanced_Computing_and_Semiconductors_to_China), that, roughly speaking, bans export of semiconductors that involve US in their manufacturing chain to China.\n\nAs the capabilities of generative AI systems grow, and as enterprise customers learn more how to extract certain types of knowledge (e.g. how to create Deep Fakes or create armies of online bots), one way US policymakers might address risks would be to apply exports control to software that are similar to the export controls for hardware used for training AI.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17102,\"question_id\":17102}}`",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nIn mid July 2025, [according to CNN:](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/17/americas/trump-not-emperor-world-lula-intl)\n\n> Trump threatened Brazil with crippling tariffs of 50% starting August 1, according to a letter posted to his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n> In the letter, Trump linked the astronomical tariff threat to what he described as a “witch hunt” trial against Brazil’s right-wing former president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\n> Bolsonaro, a close Trump ally, is facing trial in Brazil for allegedly attempting to overthrow Lula following his presidential win in 2022. He could face more than four decades behind bars if found guilty of masterminding the coup.\n\n> Speaking exclusively to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday, da Silva, who is widely known as Lula, said that Trump’s threats had broken away from “protocol” and argued that his predecessor’s fate cannot be part of trade negotiations.\n\nTop products the US imports from Brazil [are](https://www.usimportdata.com/blogs/us-imports-exports-trade-relations-with-brazil) coffee, oil, and sugar. Brazil provides about 37% of America's domestic sugar consumption needs, so a potential trade war could be coming at a time when The Coca-Cola Company [just announced](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/22/trump-coke-cane-sugar) it was switching from high fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its sodas.&#x20;\n\nIn the past couple of years, the US's trade with Brazil has been as follows:\n\n| Year | Month          | Exports (US\\$ m) | Imports (US\\$ m) |   Balance\\* |\n| ---- | -------------- | ---------------: | ---------------: | ----------: |\n| 2023 | January        |          3,592.3 |          3,100.6 |       491.7 |\n| 2023 | February       |          3,586.1 |          2,564.0 |     1,022.0 |\n| 2023 | March          |          4,119.6 |          3,170.1 |       949.5 |\n| 2023 | April          |          3,464.2 |          2,649.7 |       814.5 |\n| 2023 | May            |          4,051.7 |          3,066.0 |       985.6 |\n| 2023 | June           |          3,940.4 |          3,555.7 |       384.7 |\n| 2023 | July           |          3,427.9 |          3,320.5 |       107.4 |\n| 2023 | August         |          3,755.9 |          3,166.2 |       589.7 |\n| 2023 | September      |          3,662.7 |          3,944.0 |      −281.3 |\n| 2023 | October        |          3,580.8 |          3,127.2 |       453.6 |\n| 2023 | November       |          3,623.6 |          3,568.3 |        55.3 |\n| 2023 | December       |          3,734.2 |          3,828.1 |       −94.0 |\n| 2023 | **TOTAL 2023** |     **44,539.2** |     **39,060.5** | **5,478.7** |\n| 2024 | January        |          3,514.3 |          3,756.2 |      −242.0 |\n| 2024 | February       |          3,761.7 |          3,152.8 |       608.9 |\n| 2024 | March          |          3,928.1 |          3,181.9 |       746.2 |\n| 2024 | April          |          3,812.3 |          3,247.2 |       565.1 |\n| 2024 | May            |          4,020.4 |          3,702.4 |       318.0 |\n| 2024 | June           |          4,264.4 |          3,383.5 |       880.9 |\n| 2024 | July           |          4,175.8 |          3,537.8 |       638.0 |\n| 2024 | August         |          4,764.0 |          3,940.8 |       823.2 |\n| 2024 | September      |          4,472.5 |          3,327.1 |     1,145.3 |\n| 2024 | October        |          3,937.9 |          3,329.3 |       608.6 |\n| 2024 | November       |          4,167.8 |          3,978.8 |       189.0 |\n| 2024 | December       |          4,317.0 |          3,810.8 |       506.2 |\n| 2024 | **TOTAL 2024** |     **49,136.1** |     **42,348.4** | **6,787.7** |\n| 2025 | January        |          3,855.7 |          3,770.7 |        85.0 |\n| 2025 | February       |          4,073.1 |          3,344.5 |       728.6 |\n| 2025 | March          |          4,654.1 |          3,898.1 |       756.0 |\n| 2025 | April          |          4,254.6 |          3,184.2 |     1,070.5 |\n| 2025 | May            |          4,811.3 |          4,224.1 |       587.1 |\n|      |                |                  |                  |             |\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38918,\"question_id\":38268}}`",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe Trump administration’s first term saw a pattern of withdrawing from international arms control agreements, including:\n\n* **INF Treaty (**[**2019**](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/article/article/1924779/us-withdraws-from-intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-treaty/)**)** – U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.\n* **Open Skies Treaty (**[**2020**](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-12/news/us-completes-open-skies-treaty-withdrawal)**)** – Trump announced withdrawal, citing Russian non-compliance.\n* **Iran Nuclear Deal (**[**2018**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html)**)** – The U.S. exited the JCPOA, leading to renewed tensions.\n\nWith Trump's return to office in 2025, there is renewed concern that his administration may withdraw from key arms control agreements, particularly those seen as restricting U.S. military capabilities. The agreements most at risk include:\n\n1. [**New START**](https://www.state.gov/new-start-treaty) **(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty)**, the last remaining U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control treaty, limiting strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems. It is set to expire in 2026, but there are concerns that Trump may refuse renewal or suspend compliance before then.\n2. [**The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)**](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention), a global ban on chemical weapons with strong bipartisan support, but potential friction due to compliance disputes with China and Russia.\n3. [**The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**](https://disarmament.unoda.org/wmd/nuclear/npt/), the cornerstone of global nuclear non-proliferation. While withdrawal is unlikely, Trump has expressed skepticism toward arms control constraints in the past.\n4. [**The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)**](https://www.ctbto.org/our-mission/the-treaty), though never ratified by the U.S., Trump officials previously floated the idea of resuming nuclear testing—potentially violating the spirit of the treaty.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36025,\"question_id\":35459}}`",

Official notification of withdrawal: The U.S. government formally notifies treaty partners, the United Nations, or other relevant bodies of its intent to exit an arms control agreement.\n2. Legally binding action: The administration takes executive action, submits a withdrawal request to Congress (where required), or engages in legal or procedural steps toward exiting an agreement.\n3. Suspension of compliance: The administration officially announces that it will no longer comply with the obligations of an agreement, effectively nullifying U.S. participation.\n4. Substantive defunding: The administration or Congress enacts a significant funding cut (at least 50%) to an agreement’s implementation, undermining U.S. participation.\n\nIf no formal attempt to withdraw from any of the seven treaties is made by January 1, 2026, the question will resolve as **No**.",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe[ <u>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act) (PPACA), signed into law in the US in 2010 and commonly known as the ACA (or as Obamacare), has been subject to a[ <u>number of attempts by Republicans to repeal it</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act). While attempts at repeal were ultimately unsuccessful, the law has been subject to[ <u>a number of limitations and changes</u>](https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-the-affordable-care-act/?entry=table-of-contents-how-has-the-aca-changed-since-it-was-first-passed) imposed by subsequent court rulings and laws.\n\nFollowing President-elect Donald Trump's election victory in November 2024 along with Republican control of Congress, there has been a great deal of[ <u>speculation</u>](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/what-would-trump-do-with-the-aca-its-hard-to-tell-for-sure/) regarding the future of the ACA. In his first term Trump was[ <u>critical of the ACA</u>](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918797009133465600) and[ <u>advocated</u>](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-promoting-healthcare-choice-competition/#:~:text=And%20we%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20also%20pressure%20Congress%20very%20strongly%20to%20finish%20the%20repeal%20and%20the%20replace%20of%20Obamacare%20once%20and%20for%20all.%20We%20will%20have%20great%20healthcare%20in%20our%20country.) for it to be repealed and replaced. More recently on the campaign trail Trump has continued to[ <u>criticize the ACA</u>](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1728511466037485668), but has somewhat softened his stance by saying \"[<u>I'm not running to terminate the ACA. . .</u>](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112163485572377413)\" and instead focusing on reforms to improve the program and cut costs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has also[ <u>recently called for reforms to the ACA</u>](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853).\n\nA number of Republican reforms to the ACA have been proposed in recent years following attempts at larger repeal, most of which have abandoned full repeal and instead aim to implement a range of reforms. Some of the published proposals are:\n\n* [<u>Proposals from chapter 14 about the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</u>](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf) from the[ <u>Project 2025 Policy Agenda</u>](https://www.project2025.org/policy/)\n* The Republican Study Committee's[ <u>FY 2025 Budget Proposal</u>](https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87)\n* A[ <u>2023 opinion piece</u>](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/4-ways-repeal-obamacare) by former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\n* A[ <u>paper from the Paragon Health Institute</u>](https://paragoninstitute.org/private-health/the-great-obamacare-enrollment-fraud/), a health policy research institute run by[ <u>Brian Blase</u>](https://paragoninstitute.org/profile/brian-blase/), former economic policy advisor during Trump's first term\n\nThe ACA is lengthy and complex, but the Republican proposals generally focus on a few key aspects, described below alongside other potential targets:\n\n* **Reducing Medicaid eligibility and expenses:** The ACA expanded federal Medicaid eligibility to households with income of 133% of the federal poverty line or less ([<u>see ACA Section 2001</u>](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ148/PLAW-111publ148.pdf), effectively this threshold is [<u>138%</u>](https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/medicaid-expansion-and-you/) after accounting for other income adjustments in the law). However, Medicaid is administered through the states with some funding supplied by the federal government. The ACA was structured to tie federal funding to this expansion, but in [*<u>NFIB v. Sebelius</u>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) the Supreme Court decided that the law amounted to an invalid coercion of states and therefore the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary. Republican proposals to change this tend to view the federal Medicaid spending as excessive and wasteful, and argue for limitations on eligibility, such as via work requirements, more flexibility for states to determine eligibility, and changes to federal funding that reduce federal spending.\n* **Limiting premium tax credits:** The ACA implemented tax credits for households with earnings from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty line to offset costs for qualified healthcare plans. Republican plans have proposed narrowing eligibility, reducing subsidy amounts, or allowing subsidies to be redirected to health savings accounts (HSAs) or insurance plans that do not comply with ACA requirements.\n* **Fully eliminating the individual mandate:** The ACA mandated that individuals must have health insurance, and imposed a penalty for those without insurance. The [<u>2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set that penalty to zero</u>](https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/individual-mandate/), effectively reducing the legal force behind the mandate. However, the mandate itself is still law, despite there being no penalty associated with it.\n* **Limiting the employer mandate:** The ACA [<u>mandated that employers of certain sizes must offer health insurance coverage to their employees</u>](https://www.cigna.com/employers/insights/informed-on-reform/employer-mandate), and imposed penalties for non-compliance. This mandate is still in effect.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on subsidies and plan eligibility:** The premium tax credits and other subsidies under the ACA are generally only eligible for healthcare plans that satisfy certain criteria set forth in the ACA. Republicans [<u>have proposed</u>](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/21/nx-s1-5198483/trump-republicans-obamacare-aca-medicaid) allowing the use of subsidies for plans that do not comply with the ACA, or for contributions to Health Savings Accounts.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on medical underwriting:** [<u>Medical underwriting</u>](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medical-underwriting.asp) is the practice of insurers determining health plan eligibility and pricing based on the health characteristics of individuals or groups. The ACA prohibited medical underwriting in most cases for health insurance with the exception of [<u>consideration</u>](https://www.healthcare.gov/how-plans-set-your-premiums/) of age, location, tobacco use, family status, and plan category. It also prohibited denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. The [<u>Republican Study Committee</u>](https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87) proposal would expand the ability of insurers to use medical underwriting, arguing that the current limitations cause younger, healthier individuals to face larger health insurance expenses.\n\nWhile Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, they could pursue significant changes through budget reconciliation, a legislative process requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation was previously used in 2017 to attempt to repeal parts of the ACA, including Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies, but the effort ultimately [<u>failed by a narrow margin</u>](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/27/539907467/senate-careens-toward-high-drama-midnight-health-care-vote). Generally only [<u>changes to law that impact certain classifications of federal spending</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation) can be accomplished with reconciliation, and [<u>typically</u>](https://www.pgpf.org/article/what-is-budget-reconciliation/) only once per year.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

Repeatedly receiving IMF loans, the crisis culminated at the [turn of the millennium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%932002_Argentine_great_depression) and resulted in a majority of the population living below the poverty line. Following the crisis, Argentina underwent [debt restructuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring) and economic reforms, however economic problems persisted and by 2023 inflation had once again [surpassed 100%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-64960385).\n\nIn the [2023 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Argentine_general_election), [Javier Milei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei) was elected President of Argentina. Milei campaign on a platform of [radical economic reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei_2023_presidential_campaign) and free market policies, including dollarizing the economy, abolishing the Central Bank, and privatizing state-owned enterprises. Following the election, Milei faced political pressure and challenges and moderated his proposals, however significant economic reforms were still implemented.\n\nDuring Milei's tenure, Argentina's economy has continued to face significant challenges. Although poverty has dropped from its peak, many have lost access to basic needs programs, and although inflation declined following an initial spike, it remains far above normal levels.&#x20;\n\nPrior to Milei's presidency, Argentina had implemented significant currency controls, resulting in a split between the formal and informal rate of the Argentine Peso. Milei initially attempted to unify the exchange rate with a “crawling peg” system before eventually allowing the peso to [float freely](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/04/12/argentina-to-lift-strict-currency-controls-on-monday_6740130_4.html).

In November 2024, the International Criminal Court [issued an arrest warrant](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-state-palestine-icc-pre-trial-chamber-i-rejects-state-israels-challenges) for Netanyahu, alleging war crimes committed during the Israel–Hamas conflict.

      "description": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared [martial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Ukraine#2022_martial_law) in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began earlier that day. As the [ensuing war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_war_\\(2022%E2%80%93present\\)) has dragged on, the government has extended martial law [16 times](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/ukraine-prolongs-martial-law-mobilization-1752577500.html). (At first, each declaration of martial law was good for thirty days, but since May 2022, martial law has been extended for 90-day periods.)\n\nOne consequence of this lengthy period of martial law is that national elections, which would have occurred [in 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_parliamentary_election), have been postponed indefinitely. Nevertheless, [some observers](https://www.saisjournal.eu/article/98-George-Kent-War-and-Democracy.cfm) argue that the rule of law in Ukraine remains strong.\n\nThe current period of martial law is scheduled to expire on [November 5, 2025](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/zelenskyy-signs-extension-of-martial-law-1753442234.html), unless the government again renews it.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40227,\"question_id\":39761}}`",
