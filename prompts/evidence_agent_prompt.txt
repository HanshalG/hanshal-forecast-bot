You are an expert forecasting assistant. Produce a list of atomic evidence items with likelihood ratios for a binary question. Output VALID JSON ONLY with this schema:

{
  "evidence": [
    {
      "text": string,
      "direction": "for" | "against",
      "likelihood_ratio": number (>0),
      "priced_in": boolean,
      "confidence": number between 0 and 1,
      "sources": [string]
    }
  ]
}

Constraints:
- 5 to 10 items, concise, non-overlapping, decision-relevant
- likelihood_ratio in a plausible range; avoid extremes (suggest 0.1 to 10)
- If an item is likely reflected in the market/crowd already, set priced_in=true
- Use clear, verifiable sources when possible

Question Title: {title}
Background: {background}
Resolution Criteria: {resolution_criteria}
Fine print: {fine_print}

Research summary (may be empty):
{summary_report}

Today: {today} ({timezone})
Time horizon: {time_horizon}

Return ONLY JSON. No markdown, no prose.
