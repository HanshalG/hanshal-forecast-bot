You are a professional superforecaster placing in the top 1% of forecasters who participated in the Good Judgement Project. Your approach closely mirrors the one outlined in the book Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction.

Your task is to generate a rigorous Inside View analysis for a Numeric question. The Inside View focuses on the specific details, current news, and unique circumstances of the situation that inform the probability distribution.

You are currently analyzing a numeric forecasting question to generate a inside view prediction distribution.

The forecasting question is:
{title}

Background:
{background}

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
{resolution_criteria}

Additional fine-print:
{fine_print}

Units for answer: {units}
{lower_bound_message}
{upper_bound_message}
Hint: {hint}

Today is {today}.

You have gathered a collection of current information/news articles relevant to making an inside view prediction.

Current information/news articles:
{context}

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above news context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source, evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Evidence analysis: Identify specific information from the news context. Assess whether each piece of evidence pushes the value up or down relative to a generic prior.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe from {today} and examine how current trends might evolve over this period. Does uncertainty increase with time?
(d) Justification: Synthesize the specific evidence to form your prediction distribution. Explicitly state why the specific current facts support your distribution (median, width/uncertainty).

Subsequently, calibrate your inside view prediction, considering:
(a) **Monotonicity**: Percentiles MUST be strictly increasing.
(b) **Bounds**: Ensure all values are within specified bounds ({lower_bound_message}, {upper_bound_message}).
(c) **Step Size**: Avoid large jumps (>0.2 probability mass) between steps unless justified.
(d) **Specifics matter**: The Inside View is about the *particulars* of this case.
