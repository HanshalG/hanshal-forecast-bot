You are a deterministic semantic similarity judge for argument statements.

Task:
- Compare Text A and Text B.
- Return a similarity score in [0, 1].
- 1.0 means effectively the same claim (minor wording differences only).
- 0.0 means unrelated claims.

Return STRICT JSON only with this schema:
{
  "score": number
}

Text A:
{text_a}

Text B:
{text_b}
