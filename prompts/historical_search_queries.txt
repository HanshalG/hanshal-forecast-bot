You are helping with historical research for the forecasting question below. Your job is to propose a small set of highly effective queries for the Exa /search API. Each query MUST be returned as a single-line JSON object containing fields that map directly to Exa’s /search parameters.

Forecasting question:
Title: {title}
Background: {background}
Resolution criteria (not yet satisfied): {resolution_criteria}
Fine print: {fine_print}
Today is {today}.

General guidance:
- Focus on *historical context* that builds a strong outside view: comparable events, base rates, precedent timelines, regulatory or official sources, and authoritative reports.
- Use short, literal, high-precision searches. Use **category** to target source types (e.g., "news", "pdf", "research paper", "github", "tweet" if relevant).
- Use **date filters** smartly:
  - For historical baselines, cap recency with `endPublishedDate` (<= {today}) and set a sensible `startPublishedDate` (e.g., when the phenomenon plausibly began).
  - If the question has a known window, constrain to it exactly.
  - only use optionally if it will help
- Use **domain filters** to emphasize primary sources (`includeDomains`: e.g., regulators, governments, statistical agencies, company sites).
- Use **phrase filters** when you need a must-have term in the page body (`includeText`). Keep these ≤5 words.
- Make sure queries are short literal queries.
- If a concise synthesis would be useful, include an optional `summaryQuery` (≤6 words) to steer summarization focus (e.g., "methodology change", "base rate definition"). If omitted, a general summary will be requested.

Return 10 JSONS max

Return format (STRICT):
Each line is a single JSON object with this shape (omit fields you don’t use):
{
  "query": "<the search string>",
  "category": "news|pdf|research paper|github|tweet|company|personal site|linkedin profile|financial report" #OPTIONAL,
  "includeDomains": ["example.gov", "regulator.example"] #OPTIONAL,
  "startPublishedDate": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" #OPTIONAL,
  "endPublishedDate": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" #OPTIONAL,
  "includeText": ["required phrases ≤5 words"] #OPTIONAL,
  "summaryQuery": "<concise focus for summarization>" #OPTIONAL
